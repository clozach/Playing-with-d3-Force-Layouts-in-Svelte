# Purpose of this small project

I plan to use `d3` to help with layout in ðŸŽˆBillowðŸŽˆ, and `svelte` as the app framework. Initially, the goal was to replicate [this tutorial](http://www.puzzlr.org/force-directed-graph-minimal-working-example/) in the context of a Svelte project, but now it's moreâ€¦floaty andâ€¦balloony. ðŸ˜¬
